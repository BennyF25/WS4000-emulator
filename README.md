WS4000 emulator
 an open-source Weather STAR 4000 emulator using MAME to emulate the hardware, along with software to send data to the emulated hardware, recreated software running on the emulated hardware, and software to configure the recreated software, like configuring advertising crawls, and locations for forecasts/alerts/other settings, and anything else the WS4000 could do. it would also have software to simulate the WS4000 Audio/Video inputs and outputs so you could send video and audio to the simulated hardware and it would output an LDL or local forecast or narrations or alert beeps  on top of the incoming video source, and send it out as an IP video stream.
